# A Basic React Storefront w/ Typescript
Mostly playing around with React + TS
This is a basic storefront that lists products from jsonServer via card-deck (bootstrap)

It allows for adding units to a 'cart' and then checking out via order summary

Where it will then reset your cart back to zero

# To Run
`npm run prod-start`
Obviously expects you have to run `npm install` as well
